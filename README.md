## What I Learned

1. **HTML Tags:** I learned how to use HTML tags to create the structure of a web page. Understanding and using common HTML tags is fundamental to web development.

2. **Attributes and Settings:** I delved into the world of HTML attributes and their various settings. These attributes play a crucial role in customizing the behavior and appearance of elements on a web page.

3. **CSS Stylesheets:** I explored the power of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they can be used to control the design and layout of a website. Creating and applying CSS stylesheets enhanced the visual appeal of my project.

4. **Structuring Elements:** I gained insights into how various HTML elements come together to form different parts of a website. This knowledge allowed me to build well-structured and organized web pages.

5. **Completing a Website:** Ultimately, I was able to complete a typical website as part of my learning journey. This project served as a practical application of the concepts I had learned, tying everything together.

## Conclusion

Creating this website has been an educational and fulfilling experience. It has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to build and design web pages. I'm excited to continue my journey in web development and explore more advanced concepts in the future.
